This README file details the project and the project organization. 

Project:
  This project pulls IBTrACS hurricane data from the National Climatic Data Center website. Focusing on the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins, the main goal was to obtain, analyze, and produce visuals regarding these hurricanes. This project was completed for Statistics 133 at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2015. 
  
Project Organization: 
  Once a project has been created in Rstudio, Rstudio sets the project folder as the new working directory. The skeleton.R file details how the project's six subdirectories are created. Listed below are these subdirectories, as well as a description of the files that subdirectory contains.
